Abstract 
 
  An important step for a success in any type of company is customer retention. Studies have 
shown that hiring new recruits is 27% costlier than keeping the existing customers. Therefore 
every company has addressed the issue of churning. This is truer for ecommerce companies 
as there are many competitors in the market due to several facts like the ease of entering, can 
sell irrespective of the geographical location, delivery methods etc. So in order to thrive in 
the ecommerce world, companies must put a lot of effort to identify the churning customers 
and make proactive actions to retain them. In order to take proactive actions, identifying the 
churning customers is not enough. Hence the time of churning has also considered in this 
study.  Several approaches including different ML models, biased datasets and prediction 
types have been used in previous studies in order to achieve similar goals and they were 
discussed in the literature review. To conduct the study ecommerce purchasing data of 99456 
customers of a Brazilian ecommerce site have been recorded which has 8 features over a 
period of 6 months. By using purchase frequency and the wait between the purchases, the 
churning customers have been identified for the dataset. In order to get the time of churning, 
this study has used survival analysis techniques together with XGBoost machine learning 
method to identify the highest probable period of churning in a customer’s lifetime. There are 
many future works possible to carry forward this way of research and those are discussed in 
the future work section. Furthermore this type of study can be applied to any of the 
ecommerce companies which record the purchase data of customers and their customer 
features.

1. Introduction 
 
Maintaining a loyal client base is important for any business since getting new customers 
are costly than acquiring new ones. According to a research by Bain & Company, acquiring a 
new customer can be costly as much as 700% than retaining the existing customers. Also by 
reducing customer retention rate 5%, profits can be increased by around 25%. (retaining-
customers-is-the-real-challenge, 2006) 
 
A customer terminating the product usage is known as churning. Examples of customer churn 
include cancelation of a subscription, closure of an account, non-renewal of a contract or 
service agreement etc. This is a loss in the company’s point of view. Hence by using methods 
like churn rate prediction, product owners are in the need to identify the retention rates and 
take preventive actions to reduce it. 
 
Before the AI revolution took place, people used simple counts and tables to interpret the 
features of customers after churning and took reactive measures to control the churning. But 
with the emergence of machine learning and deep learning they were able to build models and 
predict the churning of a customer from the acquiring step itself. 
 
Traditional ML and Deep learning churn models could produce a binary output (Whether a 
customer will churn or not).  But it has a drawback that it cannot predict the exact point of 
time that the customer will churn. For example for the 3 churning customers if the preventive 
action is taken on 40th day, A customer will churn soon after getting the action, and C 
customer will churn a long time after the point of action. This will incur unnecessary costs if 
actions were taken at that point. Only for B customer the optimal results will be taken.

To overcome the problem stated in above, the proposed solution is to model the customer 
churn as a time dependant value instead of a binary value. This gives the ability to take actions 
in the correct point of time, which will save time and money. Here, actions for each customer 
can be taken at different time points rather than using a threshold for every customer. To 
achieve this type of modelling, survival analysis functions can be used. (Retain Customers 
with Time to Event Modeling-Driven Intervention, 2021) 
                
 
Figure 2 Intervention Based Churn Model 
This study aims to build a model to identify the above highest risk point of customer churning 
by using the XGBoost ML algorithm and Cox’s Proportional Hazard estimation which comes 
under survival analysis.

2. Background 
2.1 Introduction 
Churn prediction has been a popular topic of research over the years due to the importance of 
it for businesses. Hence there are many research distributed over several domains and each 
research has used different algorithms, optimizing methods or approaches for this purpose.  
This chapter aims to provide an analysis of the current studies and applications of them in the 
industry together with the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches. 
2.2 Literature review 
 The literature review section is divided in to 3 parts as, 
1. Review of the domain 
2. Review of the problem  
3. Review of theories and methodology used in building the system 
4. Review of existing systems  
2.2.1 Review of the domain  
 
With the advancement of technology people tend more to buy goods from online sources 
rather than visiting the physical store. The store used in the research has built a marketing 
funnel where the sellers can list their products on the store site and once the customers 
purchase the product through their site, the department store provide the logistics to deliver the 
items to customers. This is a method implemented so that the small sellers can sell their goods 
to customers. 
 
A churning of a customer can happen in 2 ways as in a contractual relationship and a non-
contractual relationship. Out of these customer churn in an Ecommerce setup belongs to the 
non-contractual category. This is due to not having a contract between the customer and the 
company. Furthermore the loss of a customer in an Ecommerce store can happen in 2 ways as 
intermittent lost and permanent lost. Here a intermittently loss customer can return to the 
shop but permanently lost customer is loss forever to the company.

2.2.2 Review of the problem  
 
Traditional research in this field was done by a marketing perspective rather than using 
modern learning approaches.  Researchers have tried to identify the factors affecting the 
retention by using simple data collection and comparisons. Study by (Bader, 2019) is one such 
attempt. Here, the relationship between relationship management, customer satisfaction, 
customer loyalty, customer profitability, and customer retention has been discussed.  
In regards to ecommerce business, customer retention strategies are different than offline 
marketing. (Gayathri, 2020) 
 
With the advancement of modern analytical technologies, research has been carried out to 
predict the customer churn effectively using machine learning, deep learning and other 
statistical techniques. Using these technologies, companies could predict the churn of 
customers and get proactive actions, rather than the reactive actions that were taken by 
traditional methods.  
2.2.3 Review of theories and methodology used in building the system 
 
XGBoost algorithm with lifetimes package 
XGBoost algorithm uses machine learning algorithms under gradiant boosting framework. 
This algorithm can be used with survival functions like Cox’s Proportional Hazard. Also it 
gives a higher accuracy level compared with other algorithms for similar tasks. XGBoost is a 
decision tree based ensemble method, which attempts to give a higher accuracy and 
calculation speed for predictions by using multiple decision trees in parallel and optimizing by 
calculating the error from each tree. Also it does tree pruning, handling missing values and 
regularization to avoid over fitting. (Morde, 2019)  
To calculate the churn probability of a customer with respect to time, lifetime package will be 
used. It has a number of functions which can be used with life time calculations. Predicting 
how often a visitor return to a website, Identify churned customers and predicting the life time 
value of a customer are some example applications of the package. (Davidson) With the 
ability to do predictions together with XGBoost algorithm makes the package ideal for the 
study in the paper. (developers, xgboost) 
 
 
 
 
14 
 
Survival Functions (Cox’s Proportional Hazard  / Kaplan Meyer) 
Kaplan-Meyer estimation is used to calculate the survival of an entity by feeding lifetime data. 
This method is mostly used in medical research to get the fraction of patients who are getting 
survived after giving a certain treatment. This function is also used in other fields to estimate 
the time a certain person stays unemployment after a job loss, the time taken to fail some 
machinery parts and many other applications. Kaplan-Meyer estimation is suitable in cases 
where the predictor value is categorical. It does not give good results when the predictor is a 
quantitative value. Hence in this study, this estimation will not be used for prediction 
(Understanding Kaplan-Meier Estimator (Survival Analysis), 2020) 
 
The other survival analysis method that is widely used is Cox’s Proportional Hazard (PH) 
function which can be used with both categorical and quantitative data. This function can be 
used to identify the highest risk point in customer churn. Cox’s PH model is a regression 
function. In this function the measure is taken as a hazard rate. Hazard rate can be defined as 
the risk of failure (The probability of happening the event considered) given that the 
participant has survived. This rate has to be between 0 and 1. (LaMorte, 2016) 
 
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) 
In machine learning, the interpretation of models is equally important as building them. 
Interpretation has to be done so that the stakeholder can become aware of the result that is 
produced by the model. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a method that is used in 
ML studies to get the local predictions of features that affect the global result. This method 
uses coalition game theory concepts to get the outcome and the value for each feature is 
called as a shapely value (The marginal average contribution of an instance of feature among 
all possible coalitions). (Lundberg, 2017) 
 
2.2.4 Review of existing systems  
2.2.4.1 Systems used for churn prediction 
 
Most of the existing research related to churn analysis has aimed to find out whether a 
customer will churn or not, which is a binary approach. These studies have taken one or more 
machine learning or deep learning technique to predict whether a customer will churn or not. 
One such research is done by (Lalwani, Mishra, Chadha, & Sethi, 2021). In this paper, several 
 
15 
 
machine learning models and ensemble methods were used on same dataset to compare the 
effectiveness in prediction. By the comparison, it was found that AdaBoost and XGBoost 
classifiers have shown the highest accuracy, which are 81.71% and 80.8% respectively. Also 
they have obtained highest AUC scores as well. For the model in this paper XGBoost 
classifier with several hyper parameter techniques will be used due to the high accuracy rate in 
predicting churn. 
 
For a large dataset, churning customer rate can be very low. Hence handling imbalanced 
dataset can be important when analysing. To achieve this (Wu & Meng, 2016) has used 
SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) together with AdaBoost algorithm. By 
using the SMOTE technique, a balanced dataset has been generated and it was used with Ada 
Boost algorithm to generate highly accurate predictions for ecommerce datasets. 
 
Another research was carried out a study to compare customer churn between logistic 
regression methods with Artificial Neural Network based approach. (MN & Basheer, 2003) 
Here, logistic regression method is a ML algorithm and ANN is a deep learning method. For 
comparison between two approaches Precision, Recall and AUC curves methods have been 
used. Results gave a higher classification and regression accuracy for deep learning based 
ANN approach. This would be the best model for churn prediction as a binary approach. But 
since in this study, to be able to use with survival analysis package, deep learning approach 
was not used although it has a higher accuracy value. 
 
2.2.4.2 Systems using survival analytics for churn identification 
 
A study which focused not only on the probability of churning but the time period for 
churning as well carried out by  (Jamal & Bucklin, 2006) Different types of models such as 
semi-parametric Cox Proportional Model, parametric Weibull and Log-normal survival 
models were used to build this model. The log-normal model was defined as the best model by 
such statistical criteria as a log-likelihood value. This is the concept under this study as well. 
But the model used here is the Cox Proportional Model function with the XGBoost algorithm. 
After calculating the accuracy it can be compared with this study to get the best model out of 
comparison. 
 
 
16 
 
Another study on the ways to implement survival analysis for identifying churning customers 
is done using Kaplan Meyer estimation and Weibull models (Bowick).  In this study survival 
probability of two companies are measured over time and aimed to compare between the 
churning periods of each company. This method can be used to identify the overall churning 
of a company with success but unable to use it for identifying individual customer churn. For 
evaluating individual customer churn, Cox’s Proportional hazard model will be used in this 
study. 
 
Above discussed methods are mostly implemented regression functions. Following study has 
used clustering techniques and it has been carried out to implement survival analysis for the 
automobile industry using Cox’s Proportional hazard model. This study mainly focused on 
identifying the factors which are mostly affecting the churning of a customer and by using K-
means and K- modes methods it was shown that customers can be divided in to three groups 
based on the age and churning characteristic.  (Bravante & Robielos, 2022) 
2.3 Selection of Technologies 
2.3.1 Application Platform 
Among the platforms to run the application, web based method is used for this 
system. Although currently the database is hosted locally, to take the maximum usage of the 
system it has to be hosted in the cloud which makes a web based system. By following web 
based method, users can access the system regardless of the location they are in and process 
the data real time. Since ecommerce industry is a highly active one, this method will give the 
highest benefit. 
2.3.2 Backend of the system.  
System backend comprises of two parts as the machine learning backend and 
application backend. 
2.3.2.1 Application backend 
 
As the backend of the application, Python language based FastAPI framework was 
used. The reasons for using this framework for the application are due to its speed, 
modularization capability and easy integration with frontend technologies such as reactjs. In 
order to develop the frontend APIs and to integrate with the front end extra knowledge was 
needed and I the author was able to get that knowledge using plenty of resources that were 
available online. Another reason for using this technology was the availability of good 
 
17 
 
documentation and other online resources to develop the required features of the system 
without taking loner time periods. Furthermore using python as the application backend 
makes it easier to integrate with other modules such as ML modules which are written in 
Python. 
2.3.2.2 ML modules backend 
 
There are three languages which are mainly used for ML module development, mainly R, 
Python and Java. Out of them, Python was chosen to develop the models due to author’s 
familiarity with the language and short learning curve. Due to being the most popular 
language used for the ML eco system, Python has many resources which are already 
developed which we can use to bui",1,11.0
