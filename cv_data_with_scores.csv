platform 
comprises three layers: a data engagement platform that can easily access and manage multiple 
structured and 
unstructured data sources; an Ã¢Â€Âœintent assessment and reasoningÃ¢Â€ÂNLP to handle such queries. User can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like allL1 
activities can be 
eliminated. 
Entity Extractor -> This involves text extraction and NLP for fetching out important information from the 
text like 
dates, names, places, contact numbers etc. This involves Regex, Bluemix NLU apiÃ¢Â€Â™s and machine 
learning using 
Tensor flow for further learning of new entities. 
Classifier ->This involves the classifications of classes, training of dataset and predicting the output using 
the SKLearn 
classifier (MNB, SVM, SGD as Classifier) and SGD for the optimization to map the user queries with the 
best 
suited response and make the system efficient. 
NER: A Deep Learning NER Model is trained to extract the entities from the text. Entities like Roles, Skills, 
Organizations can be extracted from raw text. RNN(LSTM) Bidirectional model is trained for extracting 
such entities 
using Keras TensorFlow framework.
